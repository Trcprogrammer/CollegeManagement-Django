# School Management System

The School Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline administrative tasks in schools, such as managing student and teacher information, courses, attendance, and grades. To start, clone the repository, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, set up the database in `settings.py`, run migrations using `python manage.py migrate`, and launch the server with `python manage.py runserver`. This system utilizes Django for the backend, ensuring a robust and scalable platform for school management needs.
